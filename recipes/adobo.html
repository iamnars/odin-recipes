  <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>2 lbs (about 1 kg) chicken pieces (legs, thighs, or a combination)</li>
    <li>1/2 cup soy sauce</li>
    <li>1/2 cup vinegar (white or cane vinegar)</li>
    <li>1 head garlic, cloves peeled and minced</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon black peppercorns</li>
    <li>2 bay leaves</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon cooking oil</li>

    <li>Salt to taste</li>
    <li>Chopped green onions (for garnish)</li>
    <li>Cooked rice (for serving)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Steps:</p>
  
  <ol>
    <li>Marinate the Chicken:
      <ul>
        <li>In a bowl, combine the chicken, soy sauce, half of the minced garlic, black peppercorns, and bay leaves. 
          Allow the chicken to marinate for at least 30 minutes, or you can refrigerate it overnight for maximum flavor.
        </li>
      </ul>  
    </li> 
    
    <li>Sear the Chicken:
      <ul>
        <li>In a large skillet or pot, heat the cooking oil over medium-high heat. 
          Remove the chicken from the marinade, reserving the marinade, and sear the chicken on all sides until browned. 
          Remove the chicken from the skillet and set aside.
        </li>
      </ul>  
    </li>
  
    <li>Saute Garlic and Make the Sauce:
      <ul>
        <li>In the same skillet, add the remaining minced garlic and sauté until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add the reserved marinade and let it simmer for a couple of minutes to reduce and intensify the flavors.</li>
      </ul>  
    </li> 
  
    <li>Add Chicken and Simmer:
      <ul>
        <li>Return the seared chicken to the skillet. 
          Pour in the water and vinegar. 
          Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low, cover, and let it simmer for about 30-40 minutes 
          or until the chicken is tender and fully cooked. 
          Stir occasionally.
        </li>
      </ul>  
    </li> 
  
    <li>Adjust Seasoning:
      <ul>
        <li>Taste the sauce and adjust the seasoning with salt if needed. 
          The soy sauce adds saltiness, so adjust according to your preference.
        </li>
      </ul>  
    </li> 
  
    <li>Thicken the Sauce (Optional):
      <ul>
        <li>If you want a slightly thicker sauce, you can uncover the skillet during the last 10 minutes of cooking 
          to allow the sauce to reduce further.
        </li>
      </ul>  
    </li> 
  
    <li>Serve:
      <ul>
        <li>Serve the Chicken Adobo over steamed rice.</li>
        <li>Garnish with chopped green onions.</li>
        <li>You can also serve it with a side of boiled eggs or sautéed vegetables.</li>
      </ul>  
    </li> 
  </ol>
